# Welcome

Hello ```np.random.random()``` stranger! Welcome to my github page.

# About me
I am a researcher with interest in computing, HPC, material science, condensed matter physics, and quantum computing, not necessarily in order I just wrote them :laughing: .

# Short Biography

I come from a city of Allahabad, in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, where I got most of my education. I did my B.Sc. from University of Allahabad, India with Physics and Mathematics as major in 2005. Then I joined the Integrated Ph.D. (M.Sc. + Ph.D.) program at Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI), Allahabad, India.

I finished my MSc in Physics from HRI in 2008, and PhD in Condensed Matter Physics in 2013. After submitting my thesis, I joined Prof. Stefano Sanvitoâ€™s research group at Trinity College, Dublin in 2013 for a year as Research Assistant, and after defending my thesis in September 2014, I continued there as post-doctoral researcher, and later as Research Fellow in the
School of Physics, and worked over a range of project that overlap material science, many-body theory, high-througput DFT and machine learning.

In February 2023, I joined Irish Centre for High End Computing (ICHEC) as Senior Computational Scientist, to work and contribute in ICHEC's Quantum Programming Initiative.
